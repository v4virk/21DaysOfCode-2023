Applying Semantic Tags

1. Create a new HTML file.
2. Create and identify a paragraph of text or a section of content that can benefit from semantic markup.
3. Replace generic <div> elements with more appropriate semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, or <footer>.
4. Save the file and open it in a web browser to ensure that the content is still displayed correctly.
