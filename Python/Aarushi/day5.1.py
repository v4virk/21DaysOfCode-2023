#1. Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input and determines whether the student has passed or failed. Assume that the passing score is 60 or greater.
score = float(input("Enter the student's score: "))

if score >= 60:
    print("The student has passed.")
else:
    print("The student has failed.")
