1. Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input and determines whether the student has passed or failed. Assume that the passing score is 60 or greater.
score = int(input("Enter the student's score: "))
if score >= 60:
    print("The student has passed.")
else:
    print("The student has failed.")

2. Write a Python program that prints all the prime numbers between two given numbers provided by the user.
lower = int(input("Enter the lower bound: "))
upper = int(input("Enter the upper bound: "))

print("Prime numbers between", lower, "and", upper, "are:")

for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                break
        else:
            print(num)
