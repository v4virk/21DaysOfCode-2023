1. Write a Python program that counts the frequency of each word in a given sentence and stores the result in a dictionary. Display the dictionary with word frequencies.
def count_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    freq_dict = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[word] += 1
        else:
            freq_dict[word] = 1
    return freq_dict

sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(count_words(sentence))

2. Write a Python program that checks if a given sentence is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet). Display an appropriate message.
import string

def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = set(string.ascii_lowercase)
    return set(sentence.lower()) >= alphabet

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
if is_pangram(sentence):
    print("The sentence is a pangram.")
else:
    print("The sentence is not a pangram.")
