1. Create two sets, "set1" and "set2," with some common elements. Print the union of the two sets with a descriptive message.
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(f"The union of {set1} and {set2} is {union_set}")

2. Write a Python program that takes two sets of integers as input and determines if one set is a subset of the other set. The program should display whether the first set is a subset of the second set, the second set is a subset of the first set, or if they have no subset relationship.
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
if set1.issubset(set2):
    print(f"{set1} is a subset of {set2}")
elif set2.issubset(set1):
    print(f"{set2} is a subset of {set1}")
else:
    print(f"{set1} and {set2} have no subset relationship")
