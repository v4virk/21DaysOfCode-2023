1. Write a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing only the common elements between the two input lists.
def common_elements(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))

2. Write a Python program to count the frequency of each element in a list and return a dictionary with the elements as keys and their frequencies as values.
def count_frequency(lst):
    freq = {}
    for item in lst:
        if item in freq:
            freq[item] += 1
        else:
            freq[item] = 1
    return freq
