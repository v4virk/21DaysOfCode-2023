1. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file called "grades.csv" containing student names and their grades. Calculate the average grade and display it with a descriptive message.
import csv

with open('grades.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    next(reader) # skip header row
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for row in reader:
        total += int(row[1])
        count += 1
    average = total / count

print(f'The average grade is {average:.2f}')
2. Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input from the user and creates two new lists: one containing the even numbers from the input list and another containing the odd numbers. The program should then write these two lists to separate files. The user should enter the filenames for the input and output files.

Example:
Input: Enter a list of integers (separated by spaces): 1 2 3 4 5 6

Output files:
even_numbers.txt:
2
4
6

odd_numbers.txt:
1
3
5
even_numbers_file = input('Enter filename for even numbers: ')
odd_numbers_file = input('Enter filename for odd numbers: ')
numbers = input('Enter a list of integers (separated by spaces): ').split()
even_numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers if int(num) % 2 == 0]
odd_numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers if int(num) % 2 == 1]
with open(even_numbers_file, 'w') as f:
    for num in even_numbers:
        f.write(f'{num}\n')
with open(odd_numbers_file, 'w') as f:
    for num in odd_numbers:
        f.write(f'{num}\n')
