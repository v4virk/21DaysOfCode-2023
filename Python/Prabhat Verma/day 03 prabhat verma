 Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the maximum of the three.
def max_of_two(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y

def max_of_three(x, y, z):
    return max_of_two(x, max_of_two(y, z))

print(max_of_three(3, 6, -5))
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers, one at a time, until they enter a negative number. The program should then terminate and compute and print the sum of all the positive integers entered by the user.

sum1 = 0
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while num >= 0:
    sum1 += num
    num = int(input("Enter another number: "))
print("The sum of all positive integers entered is", sum1)
