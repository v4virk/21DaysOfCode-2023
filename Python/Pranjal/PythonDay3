#1. Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the maximum of the three.

print("Enter 3 numbers: ")
no1,no2,no3=input(),input(),input()
max= max(no1,no2,no3)
print("Maximum number is "+max)



#2. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers, one at a time, until they enter a negative number. The program should then terminate and compute and print the sum of all the positive integers entered by the user.

print("Enter a number, put in a negative to exit: ")
num = []
while True:
    a= int(input())
    if a>-1:
        num.append(a)
    else:
        break

print("Sum: "+str(sum(num)))
