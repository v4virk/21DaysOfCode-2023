#1. Write a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the largest number from the list.

def find_largest_number(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None
    
    largest = numbers[0]  # Assume the first number is the largest
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num > largest:
            largest = num
    
    return largest

my_numbers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 2]
largest_number = find_largest_number(my_numbers)
print(largest_number)



#2. Write a Python program that finds the second smallest element in a given list and displays it with a descriptive message.

def find_second_smallest(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:  # Check if the list has at least two elements
        return None
    
    smallest = min(numbers)  # Find the smallest element
    
    second_smallest = float('inf')  # Set an initial value as infinity
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num > smallest and num < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = num
    
    return second_smallest

my_numbers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 2]
second_smallest = find_second_smallest(my_numbers)

if second_smallest is None:
    print("The list does not have a second smallest element.")
else:
    print("The second smallest element in the list is:", second_smallest)
