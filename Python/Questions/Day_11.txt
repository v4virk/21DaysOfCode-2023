Questions for Day - 11 (13-07-2023)

1. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file called "grades.csv" containing student names and their grades. Calculate the average grade and display it with a descriptive message.

2. Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input from the user and creates two new lists: one containing the even numbers from the input list and another containing the odd numbers. The program should then write these two lists to separate files. The user should enter the filenames for the input and output files.

Example:
Input: Enter a list of integers (separated by spaces): 1 2 3 4 5 6

Output files:
even_numbers.txt:
2

odd_numbers.txt:
